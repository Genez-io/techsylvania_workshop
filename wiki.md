## Introduction
Welcome to this hands-on tutorial about creating advanced prompts and integrating OpenAI using the OpenAI SDK.

Building effective prompts is like learning a new language - you’ve got to know how to ask the right questions. Crafting solid prompts is key to getting back the kind of answers you want from AI models. We’ll show you all the tips and tricks to get your prompts just right, making your AI chats smoother and way more on-point.

The OpenAI SDK is a solid tool that lets you integrate OpenAI’s language models into your projects without much fuss. We understand that prompt engineering can be tricky, and mistakes can sometimes affect the quality of your outputs. No worries, we’ll guide you through it.

So, get ready to sharpen your prompt creation skills, steer clear of common mistakes and even get your own full-stack application up and running on Genezio.

Let’s get started and tap into the exciting possibilities that OpenAI brings to your projects!

## Tech Stack

 - **OpenAI API** allow developers to integrate state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities into their software. By leveraging the OpenAI API, developers can enable functionalities like language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and text generation, enhancing the overall user experience for intelligent and interactive applications. https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction
 - **TMDB (The Movie Database)**  - a comprehensive platform that forms an integral part of many applications' tech stack, enabling developers to access a vast collection of movie data, including reviews, ratings, and other essential information, to enhance the movie-related features and functionalities of their applications. https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started
 - **React.js** is a popular JavaScript library that forms a key component in many modern tech stacks. With its component-based architecture and efficient virtual DOM rendering, React.js enables developers to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces for web applications. https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
 - **Genezio** is a platform that simplifies the process of developing serverless applications. With genezio, you can effortlessly create and host applications by writing clean and organized code in your preferred programming language (JS, TS and Dart) for both the frontend and backend. It offers typesafe APIs, autogenerated class interfaces, and the ability to directly call functions in your code, streamlining your development workflow and saving you time. https://docs.genez.io/genezio-documentation/

## Getting started
### Configuration & Prerequisites
1. Install `node & npm` https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Install genezio: `npm install genezio -g`
3. Get the API Key from OpenAI:
 - Open https://openai.com/ and click on `Sign Up`
 -  After you log in go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
 - Click `Create new secret key` and give it a name
 - Save somewhere safe the generated secret key, we will need it later on
4. Get API Key for themoviedb
 - Go to https://www.themoviedb.org/signup and create an account
 - After logged in with success to go https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api/new?type=developer and fill the form
 - Get the API key and store it somewhere safe, we will need it later on

### Clone the template
Clone the following repo:

	git clone https://github.com/Genez-io/techsylvania_workshop

This repository contains 2 folders. I recommend you to open it with an IDE:
 - `client` - all the frontend logic written in React
 - `server` - all the backend logic without the prompt that we will create in the next step

### Implement the server side
You have **TODOs** on each part of the code where you have to work on. 

 1. Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory: `cd ./techsylvania_workshop/server`
 2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
 3. Create a file named `.env` and add `OPENAI_SECRET_KEY=<your_openai_secret_key>` and `TMDB_API_KEY=<your_key>`
 5. Run genezio local test environment: `genezio local`
 6.  Go to https://app.genez.io/test-interface/local?port=8083 to test your backend - **it will not work on Safari**

### Let's first create the Prompts
#### Get Movies recommendation by user input
We will create the prompt in an interative way.
Keep in mind that is almost impossible to create a perfect prompt from the first try.

First, let's think about what we want to achieve with this prompt:
 1. Get the user input and integrate it in a prompt
 2. Get movie suggestions
 3. Generate the Output in a desired way
 4. Control the length of the output

Let's try a prompt like this one:

	// this will be dynamic
	userInput = `I am a person that likes to play tennis, 
	I am working as a software developer and in the last year I've read: 
	Are You There, Vodka?, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?.`
	
	prompt = `${userInput} Create a list with 3 movies that the user would like to watch based on the text.
	Create the output as JSON without any aditional text, note or informations a 
	one-liner with a field called "movies" which is an array of objects and each 
	object contains a field called "title" and a field called "releaseDate" without 
	any additional explanations.`
We can now test this prompt in `movie.ts` on the function ` recommendMoviesBasedOnDescription` at `this.openai.createChatCompletion`. 
After we add the prompt we can test with userInput from the **Test Interface**:
https://app.genez.io/test-interface/local?port=8083.

We will see that the prompt works just fine, but in the way we did it, it's easy for a user to *hack* into your system with **prompt injection**. This means that the user can to some prompt engineering to cancel our prompt and generate whatever he wants.

A prompt that works perfect and doesn't have this problem would be:

	prompt = `Between """ """ I will write what a person says about themselves. 
	Create a list with 3 movies that the person would like to watch 
	based on the text. Create the output as JSON one-liner with a 
	field called "movies" which is an array of objects and each 
	object contains a field called "title" and a field called 
	"releaseDate" without any additional explanations.

    """
    ${userInput}
    """` 
The output will consistently be in JSON format for easy parsing. Another check to avoid prompt injection is to try to parse the result on the server side, and if an error occurs notify the user.

The sdk call will look something like this:

	const completion = await this.openai.createChatCompletion({
		model:  "gpt-3.5-turbo",
		messages: [
			{
			'role':  ChatCompletionRequestMessageRoleEnum.System,
			'content':  prompt
			}
		],
		max_tokens:  2048
	});
	

#### Get Movies Reviews Summary
Now we will work in the function `getReviewSummary` from `movie.ts`.
This prompt is easier than the previous one because here we control the input and we don't have the problem with prompt injection.
We only give a list of reviews and give to OpenAi the task to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of watching that movie.
The prompt should be something like this:

	prompt = `Here is a list of reviews for one movie. One review is delimited by ||| marks.
	${reviews.map((x: string) =>  `|||${x.length  >  100 ? x.substring(0, 100) : x}|||`).join("\n")}
	Your task is to analyze each review and give me a list of advantages and
	disadvantages to watch the movie.
	The result should be one JSON object with two fields "advantages" and "disadvantages".
	Synthesize the reviews in these two fields. The advantages should contain the positives
	and the disadvantages the negatives. Don't use more than 30 words for each.
	Don't include anything else besides the JSON.`
 We use the delimiter `|||` to help the model understand easier where are the given reviews in the prompt.

### Test the full-stack app
Now we have the backend complete and we can test also the frontend application.
In a new terminal start the frontend application:

 1. Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory: `cd ./../client`
 2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
 3. Start the frontend application: `npm start`
 4. Go to http://localhost:3000 to try your app

### Deploy your app
If everything goes well you can now deploy your application on genezio's infrasctructure.
In the server folder:

 1. Login your CLI to the genezio cloud: `genezio login`
 2. Deploy your app to the genezio cloud: `genezio deploy`

This action might take up to 2 minutes and after that a random genezio subdomain will be provided for you with your deployed application.
